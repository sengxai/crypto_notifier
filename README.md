# Simple Crypto Notifier

Just a simple price notifier that sends out emails/sms.

In my case I had it sent to my phone # which you can edit in your secrets.py file

Uses Kucoins API to get current prices from Kucoin


If it hits a certain percentage/threshold it
sends an email to your email or a phone #.
    
Future implementations: 
    
    (1) Code cleanup
    
    (2) After a certain amount of time
    or after a newer low point make that the initial price then
    compare to the current price.
    
    (3) Implement algorithmic paper trades.

    (4) Get 24 hour chart price and get the percentage gains/loss of current price
